<h1 align="center">Title of my Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](http://)

My focus is to create a easy to navigate site with clear signposting of links and pages. I want customer to be able to quickly find prices and membership options, find out where the Gym is located, and when we are open. I want customers to be able to find this information using my website rather than needing to contact the Gym by phone or email to ask for the answers to their questions.
I am looking for this to be a value to the customer as it should answer all of their questions by navigating a few pages on the site, and help them establish whether they would like to try out or join the Gym.
My website should help to show prospective customers the offers and facilities at the Gym, and helping to secure new business and retain existing customer with relivant and clear information and access to their Online Account.
